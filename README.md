# NEB-NWCHEM Tutorial
Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) through nwchem for SN2 reactions tutorial.

A simple walkthrough and template for NEB runs on nwchem.

When I worked in a natural materials research group, I try to study quantum mechanics simulations. Some software for doing quantum simulations are mostly paid, and I found there is open source software, namely nwchem. I decided to put together a simple template for nwchem in terms of Reaction Path Calculations. There are two (maybe more) ways that I understand when using nwchem, namely from neb and QM/MM-NEB.

## 1. NEB
